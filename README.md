# MyPythonJournal

Hello! After nearly 4 years studying computer science, I've decided to compile all the important things that I've learnt into this repository!
Since Python is my favored language, I will be going through Python foundations and algorithms!


## Topics
### [What is Python](what-is-python.md)
### [Variables and data types](variables.md)

### Control Flow
- Conditional logic
  - if statements
  - comparison operators
  - logical operators (and, or, not)
  - truth and false
- Loops
  - forloops
  - while loops
  - break, continue, pass
  - loop nesting
  - common loop patterns
### Data Structures
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries
### Functions
- Defining functions
- Parameters and return values
- Default arguments
- Scope (local vs global)
### Error Handling
- Common Errors (TypeError, ValueError, IndexError

- Raising exceptions
- Debugging techniques
### Working with Files and OS
- Reading and writing files
### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
